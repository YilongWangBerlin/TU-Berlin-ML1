# TU Berlin Machine Learning 1 (ML1) Assignments & Lectures
This repository contains assignments and lecture materials for **Machine Learning 1 (ML1)** at **TU Berlin**. This repository contains theoretical/programming exercises and my personal solutions for altklausur from the ML1 course. Contributions and discussions are welcome! 

**Please note that these exercises and exam solutions are based on my personal work, and I cannot guarantee their correctness.**


**Altklausur Solutions:** In the same directory, you can find **solutions to Altklausur** written by me inside the `exam/` folder.

**Exam in WS24/25:** See **[ML1_GedaÌˆchtnisprotokoll_08_3_2025.pdf](./ML1_GedÃ¤chtnisprotokoll_08_3_2025.pdf)**, which contains exam topics based on my exam experience.
